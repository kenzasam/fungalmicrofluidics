Class to access the Arduino-Bridge Analog inputs and outputs.
This class is using the BridgeSerial class object to communicate over serial
with the GSOF_ArduinoBridge firmware.
The packet has a binary byte based structure
byte0 - 'P' for PWM-Out, 'A' for Analog-In
byte1 - pin bumber (binary-value)
byte2 - pwm-value (binary-value) only for analog-out command
