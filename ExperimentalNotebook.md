**Experiment details**

530nm excitation, 100um core fiber. 50ng/L resorufin drops, in HFE 7500 2% surfactant. arpund 280nm emmission, 200um core fiber to Flame spec.
Operating flame with ArduBridge lib threadSpec and specplot.

**Notes**
- Can't zoom on graph when reading spectrum
- For resorufin 50ng/L need int time of 500000 us
- Tested with Resorufin in plastic syringe
- Bridge tube was squeezed and thus resulted in tiny drops
- final flowrates: : 0.001uL/s and oil 0.005uL/s

**To Do**
- send from Threadspec the int time to Specplot, whenever it is changed
- call Thorlabs, figure out the right fibers for filter setup.
- new bridge, flat cut
Xled is 565nm, grenn: 590nm and 530nm.... Look for new led module
